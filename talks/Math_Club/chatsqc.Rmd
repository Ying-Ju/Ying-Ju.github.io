# Background: Generative AI

.content-box-gray[

]

.font90[
-  The generated content is based on a .bold[.red[stochastic behavior embedded in generative AI models such that the same input prompts results in different content]].
- State-of-the-art generative AI models can have up to **540 billion parameters** ([PaLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311)).  
- With the increase in model size, researchers have observed the **“emergent abilities”** of LLMs, which were **not explicitly encoded in the training**. [Examples include](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/characterizing-emergent-phenomena-in.html):
  + Multi-step arithmetic,   
  + taking college-level exams, and 
  + identifying the intended meaning of a word.  
- LLMs are **foundation models** (see [Bommasani et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258)), large pre-trained AI systems
that can be **repurposed with minimal effort across numerous domains and diverse tasks.**

# Our Overarching Research Question

.content-box-red[
.bold[What can generative LLM-based AI tools do now to augment the roles of SPC practitioners, educators, and researchers?]

]

-  **Secondary goal:** To motivate the SPC community to be receptive to exploring whether new AI tools can help them be more **efficient**, **productive**, and **innovative**. This is consistent with:

  + Box and Woodall ([2012](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/08982112.2012.627003)): “we stress the necessity for the quality engineering community to strengthen and promote its role in **innovation**”, and  
  + Hockman and Jensen ([2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/08982112.2015.1083107)): “for statisticians to be successful in leading innovation, they will need to strengthen their **skills beyond what they have traditionally needed in the past**, but we believe this will be worth the effort”.  
  
- **Scope:** We evaluated the utility of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 engine) as of its *Jan 30 Version*.

# Our Study Design

# The Good: Knowledge Generation


.bold[Inspired by the TEDxBoston talk titled [what we learned from 5 million books](https://www.ted.com/talks/jean_baptiste_michel_erez_lieberman_aiden_what_we_learned_from_5_million_books?language=en), we asked ChatGPT the following question:]

<br>

> .bold[.large["What are open issues in statistical process control research?'']]

<br>

### Why this question seemed like a reasonable prompt?
.bold[ChatGPT likely “read” and “can recall” more SPC research papers than most of us]

# The Good: Knowledge Generation

```{r spc_research_knowledge, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.alt='Chat GPT highlighted six areas where there are open issues in statistical process control. We will highlight the main themes in the next slide'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/research_prompt_08_fig_01.png')
```

# The Good: Knowledge Generation

.content-box-red[
.center[.bold[.large[Some Thoughts on the ChatGPT Answer]]]

- It captured .bold[reasonable themes, e.g., ]
  + incorporating .bold[big data and machine learning] techniques, 
  + .bold[online/real-time monitoring] solutions where 100% sampling is employed, 
  + the need for .bold[non-normality], and 
  + .bold[applications to new domains].  

- In our opinion, .bold[value is in using it as a high-level tool for idea generation/validation].  
- Potentially .bold[“stale”] as [Chat(GPT)-3.5 “finished training in early 2022”](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) and is limited to [data up to Sept 2021](https://community.openai.com/t/knowledge-cutoff-date-of-september-2021/66215).  
  + Probably not an issue for future LLM generations (.bold[Why?])

# The Bad: Precise Definitions

```{r imprecise, out.width='43%', echo=FALSE, fig.alt="ChatGPT's generated response for our prompt of explain the practitioner-to-practitioner variability. Its response is somewhat long and imprecise. Specifically, ChatGPT presented five factors, which share a common feature; all deal with differences on the method level, i.e., chart type, subgroup design, techniques to calculate the limits, dealing with outliers, and choice of software. While we agree that these factors are important and will drive different results, ChatGPT's answer ignores the context for which the practitioner-to-practitioner variability is used in the SPC literature. In fact, the practitioner-to-practitioner variability refers to the variation that occurs with a fixed configuration of the five aforementioned factors, i.e., the variation results from multiple implementations of the same procedure on the same data-generating process."}

# The Ugly: ChatGPT's Hallucination

.bold[To detect whether ChatGPT can detect erroneous requests, we asked:]

<br>

> .bold[.large["Can you use the ‘bigfish' dataset from the qcc library in R to create a control chart?'']]

<br>

### Why this question seemed like a reasonable prompt?
.bold[In an earlier question (within the same thread), ChatGPT answered a question by using the `qcc` package, i.e., is .red[familiar with it], and .red[detecting unreasonable requests would be a strong feature for non-expert users].]

# Concluding Remarks

.font90[
- **Educational Grounding:** *ChatSQC* uniquely grounds its answers in the [NIST/SEMATECH e-handbook of Statistical Methods](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/index.htm), ensuring users receive authoritative and educational responses.  

- **Transparency in Answers:** Instead of merely serving answers, we provide links, snapshots of the five most relevant text passages (along with their L2 distances to the prompt), and the costs incurred to generate these responses.

- **Enhanced Privacy:** By utilizing the OpenAI API: [At OpenAI, protecting user data is fundamental to our mission. We do not train our models on inputs and outputs through our API](https://openai.com/api-data-privacy).  

- Our **Roadmap:**  
    + Utilizing open-source LLMs.  
    + Working with Wiley to get permission to include copyrighted materials such as [Introduction to Statistical Quality Control](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Introduction+to+Statistical+Quality+Control%2C+8th+Edition-p-9781119399308).  
    + Incorporating multiple sources/retrievers in *ChatSQC*.  
    + Incorporating additional feedback from the community.
