The data are from a dew-retting experiment in Ballarat 1942-43, in which flax was laid out under various climatic conditions and for various periods. Retting involves softening the flax stems by soaking in water, thus enabling the separation of the linen fibres from the wooden material by a process called scrutching.
The flax variety used was "Liral Crown". Two samples were taken from each trial and the ret loss (Y), as a percentage, was calculated. 

Here is the information for all variables. 

1. loss: the ret loss (in %)
2. rainfall: mean daily rainfall (in points)
3. period: the retting period (in days)
4. temperature: mean daily temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit)

The response variable is the ret loss.
